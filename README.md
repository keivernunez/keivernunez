## Hi there 👋 welcome to my GitHub


### My name is Keiver Nuñez | Data Scientist | Geospatial and Data enthusiast. 

I am a Data Scientist with over 6 years of experience working with data, bridging the gap between complex raw data and strategic business decisions. My background in Geodetic Engineering, combined with a current Master's in Data Science, allows me to approach problems with strong mathematical rigor and a pragmatic business mindset.

Currently, I focus on building Machine Learning models, working with data to drive performance in the AgTech sector, eager to explore the finance industry.

## Selected Projects & Experience

### 1. Strategic Churn Prediction & Profit Maximization (Kaggle Competition)
Developed a high-performance churn prediction model for a Premium Service portfolio, focusing on maximizing economic return rather than standard classification metrics.
* **Stack:** LightGBM, R/Python, Bayesian Optimization (mlrMBO), Google Cloud Platform.
* **Business Impact:** Optimized a custom profit function (`Gain = 117000 * TP - 3000 * FP`), prioritizing high-value retention over generic accuracy.
* **Key Challenges:** * Mitigated **Concept & Data Drifting** in a high-inflation context by applying economic index adjustments (FACPCE).
    * Implemented **Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization** to minimize model variance and prevent overfitting on public leaderboards.
    * Engineered features from historical data to capture behavioral trends.

### 2. Content Discovery & Recommendation Engine (LightFM)
Designed and implemented a matrix factorization-based recommendation system to personalize content delivery for users of MyAnimeList, optimizing for high engagement metrics.
* **Stack:** Python, LightFM, GridSearchCV, Pickle (Serialization).
* **Methodology:**
    * Applied **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques to handle sparsity in large interaction matrices (>150 ratings filter).
    * Orchestrated a pipeline with **Hyperparameter Tuning** (GridSearchCV) to maximize model performance.
    * Serialized training artifacts (Pickle) to ensure modularity and faster inference times.
* **Evaluation:** Validated model effectiveness using industry-standard ranking metrics: **Precision at K** (P@k) and **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**.

### 3. Large-Scale Crop Classification (Machine Learning)
Developed and deployed supervised learning models (Random Forest) to classify crop types across millions of hectares using multi-temporal satellite imagery.
* **Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Google Earth Engine.
* **Impact:** Replaced manual estimation methods, increasing accuracy and reducing reporting time by 40%. Created PowerBI reports to share information with general audience.
* **Key Challenge:** Handling class imbalance and high-dimensional geospatial data.

### 4. Enterprise Data Warehouse Implementation (Product Owner)
Served as the Client-side Product Owner and Technical Lead for the migration of legacy systems to a centralized Data Warehouse, overseeing the external engineering team.
* **Role:** Defined technical requirements, conducted code/architecture reviews, and validated contractor deliverables against business needs.
* **Impact:** Ensured data integrity during migration and democratized data access across the organization by bridging the gap between internal stakeholders and the vendor.
